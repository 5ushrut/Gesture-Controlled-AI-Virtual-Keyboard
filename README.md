# Gesture-Controlled-AI-Virtual-Keyboard
This program lets you type on your computer just by using your hand and a webcam. You move your hand to point at keys on a virtual keyboard shown on the screen, and when you pinch your thumb and index finger together, it “presses” that key for you. The letters you type appear in any open application, as if you were using a real keyboard.
